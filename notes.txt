Yo yo, here's the website notes:

    -Change main background to feather stillframe (or whichever one we choose, still have to get it from Nico)
    -Take out live session videos and put in Main Street video
    -Take out Watson artwork, and put Main Street artwork above Suproe
    -Change online store section to read something like "Merch Available at Shows; for Special Orders reach out to timekingofficial@gmail.com"
-widgets: add Apple Music and Spotify, maybe put them more up towards the top rather than bottom? Your call

-Main Street video: James was wondering if we could embed it wide screen "basically to hit end to end to be in line with the banner" he said
    -Maybe add under Main Street video like a nice looking message that reads something like "New Music Coming Soon..."

The aesthetic stuff do what you can, mostly the content and background are what's important



But I'd be interested to see the new banner go under the Music/Tour/Shop/Contact. Then the animation bumper below that. Then the feather background with the Main Street video + linked album covers?
Orrr
Main top section links, then new banner, then feather background with Main Street video and album, then time king animation bumper
Then do music section with supr≈ì, this Christmas album covers. Then show dates remain the same
Maybe from then on it can be the same
